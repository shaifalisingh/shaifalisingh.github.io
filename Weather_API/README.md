#Weather API Solution

Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: 
* **Temperature (F) vs. Latitude**
* **Humidity (%) vs. Latitude** 
* **Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude**
* **Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude**

The notebook has: •	Randomly selected at 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. •	Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls o	Use of openweathermap o	from random import uniform o	#!pip install citipy o	from citipy import citipy •	Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL. •	Number of plots with various factors.
