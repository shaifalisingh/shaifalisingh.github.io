</ul>
<h3 class="heading">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are many different combinations of observations possible with the amount of data collected. This data could be enhanced to capture more factors like education level, quality of Education in high schools in the area etc and then can be used to take some insightful action to improve the economic conditions of states.</p>
